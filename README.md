# Electronics-Mosfet-Touch-Switch-On-Off
Small Electronic Circuit of a Touch-Sensitive On/Off switch using a MOSFET

LIST OF MATERIALS :

1 - Voltage Source (In my case I used the 5V pin on my Arduino, but you can also use batteries, etc. NOTE : The LED resistor should be changed according to the Voltage of the source that you have)
2 - LED
3 - Resistor (100 Ohm in my case)
4 - IRF840 MOSFET N-CHANNEL
5 - Stripped Copper Wires(for the touch part)
